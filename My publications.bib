Design               Case--control web-based questionnaire study.                                         Setting               Questionnaire data were collected in the Capital Region of Denmark in December 2020 when limited restrictions were in place, while the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases increased rapidly.                                         Participants               8913 cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with two groups of controls: (1) 34\,063 individuals with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test from the same date (negative controls, NCs) and 2) 25\,989 individuals who had never been tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection (untested controls, UC). Controls were matched on sex, age, test date and municipality.                                         Exposure               Activities during the 14 days prior to being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or during the same period for matched controls and precautions taken during the entire pandemic.                                         Main outcomes and measures               SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rate ratios (IRR).                                         Results               Response rate was 41.4\% (n=93\,121). Using public transportation, grocery shopping (IRR: NC: 0.52; UC: 0.63) and outdoor sports activities (NC: 0.75; UC: 0.96) were not associated with increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most precautions, for example, using hand sanitizer (NC: 0.79; UC: 0.98), physical distancing (NC: 0.79; UC: 0.82) and avoiding handshakes (NC: 0.74; UC: 0.77), were associated with a lower rate of infection. Activities associated with many close contacts, especially indoors, increased rate of infection. Except for working from home, all types of occupation were linked to increased rate of infection.                                         Conclusions               In a community setting with moderate restrictions, activities such as using public transportation and grocery shopping with the relevant precautions were not associated with an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exposures and activities where safety measures are difficult to maintain might be important risk factors for infection. These findings may help public health authorities tailor their strategies for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {Background Households are high-risk settings for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely associated with the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We therefore aimed to assess the association between SARS-CoV-2 exposure within households and COVID-19 severity. Methods We performed a Danish nationwide register-based cohort study including laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from 22 February to 6 October 2020. Household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as having one individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the household. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the association between `critical COVID-19' within and between households with and without secondary cases. Results From 15,063 multi-person households, 19,773 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were included; 11,632 were categorized as index cases without any secondary household cases, 3,431 as index cases with secondary cases, i.e. 22.8\% of multi-person households, and 4,710 as secondary cases. `Critical COVID-19' occurred in 2.9 \% of index cases living with no secondary cases, 4.9 \% of index cases with secondary cases, and 1.3 \% of secondary cases. The adjusted hazard ratio for `critical COVID-19' among index cases versus secondary cases within the same household was 2.50 (95\%CI=1.88-3.34), 2.27 (95\%CI=1.77-2.93) for index cases in households with no secondary cases versus secondary cases, and 1.1 (95\%CI=0.93-1.30) for index cases with secondary cases versus index cases without secondary cases. Conclusion We found no increased hazard ratio of `critical COVID-19' among household members of infected SARS-CoV-2 index cases.},

Objective               To examine the association between the response times of ambulances with lights and sirens and 30-day mortality.                                         Design               A registry-based cohort study using data collected from 2014--2018.                                         Settings and participants               This study included 182\>895 individuals who, during 2014--2018, were dispatched 266\>265 ambulances in the Capital Region of Denmark.                                         Outcome measures and analysis               The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Subgroup analyses were performed on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, ambulance response priority subtypes, and caller-reported symptoms of chest pain, dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and traffic accidents. The relation between variables and 30-day mortality was examined with logistic regression.                                         Results               Unadjusted, short response times were associated with higher 30-day mortality rates across unadjusted response time quartiles (0--6.39 min: 9\%; 6.40--8.60 min: 7.5\%, 8.61--11.80 min: 6.6\%, {$>$}11.80 min: 5.5\%). This inverse relationship was consistent across subgroups, including chest pain, dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and response priority subtypes. For traffic accidents, no significant results were found. In the case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, longer response times of up to 10\>min correlated with increased 30-day mortality rates (0--6.39 min: 84.1\%; 6.40--8.60 min: 86.7\%, 8.61--11.8 min: 87.7\%, {$>$}11.80 min: 85.5\%). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, and call-related symptoms were associated with 30-day mortality, but response time was not (OR: 1.00 (95\% CI [0.99--1.00])).                                         Conclusion               Longer ambulance response times were not associated with increased mortality, except for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.},

This registry-based study used Danish national registry data until 5 July 2020. We examined all-cause mortality rates among all deaths recorded from 2015 to 2020 and among chronic conditions (cardiovascular (cardiac \& circulatory), chronic pulmonary, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and diabetes), comparing each week in 2020 to weeks in 2015--2019. In 2020, there were 28,363 deaths in weeks 1--27 (30 December 2019--5 July 2020), the mean deaths in 2015--2019 were 28,630 deaths (standard deviation 784). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in weeks 3--10 of 2020 was low, peaking in week 14 (17.6 per 100,000 persons in week 9, 19.9 per 100,000 in week 14). Comorbidity prevalence among deceased individuals was similar in 2020 and 2015--2019: 71.1\% of all deceased had a prior cardiovascular diagnosis, 30.0\% of all deceased had a prior cardiac diagnosis. There were 493 deaths with COVID-19 in weeks 11--27, (59.8\% male), and 75.1\% had a prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Weekly mortality rates for pre-existing chronic conditions peaked in week 14, and then declined.

We aimed to investigate age-related differences in symptom presentations of patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2.                                         Design                                         Setting               Calls to the medical helpline (1-8-1-3) and emergency number (1-1-2) in Copenhagen, Denmark. At both medical services all calls are recorded.                                         Participants                                We included calls for patients who called for help/guidance at the medical helpline or emergency number prior to receiving a test for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1                 st                 and 20                 th                 2020 (8423 patients). Among these calls, we randomly sampled recorded calls from 350 patients who later tested positive and 250 patients tested negative and registered symptoms described in the call.                                                        Outcome                                         Results               After exclusions, 544 calls (312 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 232 negative) were included in the analysis. Fever and cough remained the two most common of COVID-19 symptoms across all age groups and approximately 42\% of SARS-CoV-2 positive and 20\% of negative presented with both fever and cough. Symptoms including nasal congestion, irritation/pain in throat, muscle/joint pain, loss of taste and smell, and headache were common symptoms of COVID-19 for patients younger than 60 years; whereas loss of appetite and feeling unwell were more commonly seen among patients over 60 years. Headache and loss of taste and smell were rare symptoms of COVID-19 among patients over 60 years.                                         Conclusion               Our study identified age-related differences in symptom presentations of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients calling for help or medical advice. The specific symptoms of loss of smell or taste almost exclusively reported by patients younger than 60 years. Differences in symptom presentation across age groups must be considered when screening for COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Myocardial infarction (MI) patients presenting without chest pain are a diagnostic challenge. They receive suboptimal prehospital management and have high mortality. To elucidate potential benefits of improved management, we analysed expected outcome among non-chest pain MI patients if hypothetically they (1) received emergency ambulances/acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as often as observed for chest pain patients, and (2) all received emergency ambulance/ASA.                                         Methods               We sampled calls to emergency and non-emergency medical services for patients hospitalized with MI within 24~h and categorized calls as chest pain/non-chest pain. Outcomes were 30-day mortality and a 1-year combined outcome of re-infarction, heart failure admission, and mortality. Targeted minimum loss-based estimation was used for all statistical analyses.                                         Results               Among 5418 calls regarding MI patients, 24\% (1309) were recorded with non-chest pain. In total, 90\% (3689/4109) of chest pain and 40\% (525/1309) of non-chest pain patients received an emergency ambulance, and 73\% (2668/3632) and 37\% (192/518) of chest pain and non-chest pain patients received prehospital ASA. Providing ambulances to all non-chest pain patients was not associated with improved survival. Prehospital administration of ASA to all emergency ambulance transports of non-chest pain MI patients was expected to reduce 30-day mortality by 5.3\% (CI 95\%: [1.7\%;9\%]) from 12.8\% to 7.4\%. No significant reduction was found for the 1-year combined outcome (2.6\% CI 95\% [-~2.9\%;8.1\%]). In comparison, the observed~30-day mortality was 3\% among ambulance-transported chest pain MI patients.                                         Conclusions               Our study found large differences in the prehospital management of MI patients with and without chest pain. Improved prehospital ASA administration to non-chest pain MI patients could possibly reduce 30-day mortality, but long-term effects appear limited. Non-chest pain MI patients are difficult to identify prehospital and possible unintended effects of ASA might outweigh the potential benefits of improving the prehospital management. Future research should investigate ways to improve the prehospital recognition of MI in the absence of chest pain.},

Methods and results               Copenhagen, Denmark has a 24-h non-emergency medical helpline and an emergency number 1-1-2 (equivalent to 9-1-1). Both services register symptoms/purpose of calls. Among patients with MI as either hospital diagnosis or cause of death within 72\,h after a call, the primary symptom was categorized as chest pain, atypical symptoms (breathing problems, unclear problem, central nervous system symptoms, abdominal/back/urinary, other cardiac symptoms, and other atypical symptoms), unconsciousness, non-informative symptoms, and no recorded symptoms. We identified 4880 emergency and 3456 non-emergency calls from patients with MI. The most common symptom was chest pain (N\,=\,5219) followed by breathing problems (N\,=\,556). Among patients with chest pain, 95\% (3337/3508) of emergency calls and 76\% (1306/1711) of non-emergency calls received emergency dispatch. Mortality was 5\% (163/3508) and 3\% (49/1711) for emergency/non-emergency calls, respectively. For atypical symptoms 62\% (554/900) and 17\% (137/813) of emergency/non-emergency calls received emergency dispatch and mortality was 23\% (206/900) and 15\% (125/813). Among unconscious, patients 99\%/100\% received emergency dispatch and mortality was 71\%/75\% for emergency/non-emergency calls. Standardized 30-day mortality was 4.3\% for chest pain and 15.6\% for atypical symptoms, and associations between symptoms and emergency dispatch remained in subgroups of age and sex.                                         Conclusion               Myocardial infarction patients presenting with atypical symptoms when calling for help have a reduced chance of receiving an emergency dispatch and increased 30-day mortality compared to MI patients with chest pain.},

  abstract = {In situations with non-manipulable exposures, interventions can be targeted to shift the distribution of intermediate variables between exposure groups to define interventional disparity indirect effects. In this work, we present a theoretical study of identification and nonparametric estimation of the interventional disparity indirect effect among the exposed. The targeted estimand is intended for applications examining the outcome risk among an exposed population for which the risk is expected to be reduced if the distribution of a mediating variable was changed by a (hypothetical) policy or health intervention that targets the exposed population specifically. We derive the nonparametric efficient influence function, study its double robustness properties and present a targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) procedure. All theoretical results and algorithms are provided for both uncensored and right-censored survival outcomes. With offset in the ongoing discussion of the interpretation of non-manipulable exposures, we discuss relevant interpretations of the estimand under different sets of assumptions of no unmeasured confounding and provide a comparison of our estimand to other related estimands within the framework of interventional (disparity) effects. Small-sample performance and double robustness properties of our estimation procedure are investigated and illustrated in a simulation study.},

Participants               All women aged 15-49 years residing in Denmark between 1996 and 2021, with no history of arterial or venous thrombosis, antipsychotics use, cancer, thrombophilia, liver disease, kidney disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, infertility treatment, hormone therapy use, oophorectomy, and hysterectomy.                                         Main outcome measures               First time diagnosis of ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction at discharge.                                         Results               Among 2\,025\,691 women followed up for 22\,209\,697 person years, 4730 ischaemic strokes and 2072 myocardial infarctions occurred. Standardised ischaemic stroke rate per 100\,000 person years were 18 (95\% confidence interval 18 to 19) for no use, 39 (36 to 42) for combined oral contraception, 33 (25 to 44) for progestin-only pills, and 23 (17 to 29) for intrauterine device. Standardised myocardial infarction rate per 100\,000 person years were 8 (8 to 9) for no use, 18 (16 to 20) for combined oral contraception, 13 (8 to 19) for progestin-only pills, and 11 (7 to 16) for intrauterine device. Compared with no use, current use of combined oral contraception was associated with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.0 (1.9 to 2.2) for ischaemic stroke and 2.0 (1.7 to 2.2) for myocardial infarction. These corresponded to standardised rate differences of 21 (18 to 24) extra ischaemic strokes and 10 (7 to 12) extra myocardial infarctions per 100\,000 person years. Compared with no use, current use of progestin-only pills was associated with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.6 (95\% CI 1.3 to 2.0) for ischaemic stroke and 1.5 (1.1 to 2.1) for myocardial infarction, equating to 15 (6 to 24) extra ischaemic strokes and four (-1 to 9) extra myocardial infarctions per 100\,000 person years. Increased arterial thrombotic risk was also observed with use of the combined vaginal ring (adjusted incidence rate ratio of 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7) for ischaemic stroke and 3.8 (2.0 to 7.3) for myocardial infarction), patch (3.4 (1.3 to 9.1) and no myocardial infarctions), and progestin-only implant (2.1 (1.2 to 3.8) and {$\leq$}3 myocardial infarctions), whereas no increased risk was observed with progestin-only intrauterine device (1.1 (1.0 to 1.3) for ischaemic stroke and 1.1 (0.9 to 1.3) for myocardial infarction).                                         Conclusions               Use of contemporary oestrogen-progestin and progestin-only contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke and, in some cases, myocardial infarction except for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, which was not associated with either. Although absolute risks were low, clinicians should include the potential risk of arterial thrombosis in their assessment of the benefits and risks when prescribing a hormonal contraceptive method.},

We aimed to examine health care contacts in patients before OHCA compared with the general population that did not experience an OHCA.                                         Methods and Results                                Patients with OHCA with a presumed cardiac cause were identified from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry (2001--2014) and their health care contacts (general practitioner [GP]/hospital) were examined up to 1~year before OHCA. In a case-control study (1:9), OHCA contacts were compared with an age- and sex-matched background population. Separately, patients with OHCA were examined by the contact type (GP/hospital/both/no contact) within 2~weeks before OHCA. We included 28~955 patients with OHCA. The weekly percentages of patient contacts with GP the year before OHCA were constant (25\%) until 1~week before OHCA when they markedly increased (42\%). Weekly percentages of patient contacts with hospitals the year before OHCA gradually increased during the last 6~months (3.5\%--6.6\%), peaking at the second week (6.8\%) before OHCA; mostly attributable to cardiovascular diseases (21\%). In comparison, there were fewer weekly contacts among controls with 13\% for GP and 2\% for hospital contacts (                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Within 2~weeks before OHCA, 57.8\% of patients with OHCA had a health care contact, and these patients had more contacts with GP (odds ratio [OR], 3.17; 95\% CI, 3.09--3.26) and hospital (OR, 2.32; 95\% CI, 2.21--2.43) compared with controls.                                                        Conclusions               The health care contacts of patients with OHCA nearly doubled leading up to the OHCA event, with more than half of patients having health care contacts within 2~weeks before arrest. This could have implications for future preventive strategies.},

  abstract = {The impact of resuscitation care initiatives on sex-differences in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival remains unclear. We aim to examine sex-differences in characteristics and survival.This Danish register-based study (2001--2020) included adult patients with a presumed cardiac cause of arrest. Temporal trends in survival were stratified by sex and subgroups: (i) bystander-witnessed status; (ii) bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); (iii) initial shockable heart rhythm; and age groups of \&lt;50, 50--75, and \&gt;75 years. To examine the association between sex and survival, we conducted adjusted logistic regression analyses. Among 50 066 OHCAs, women represented 34\%. Women were older, had more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic conditions than men. Women also had more OHCA at home (83.4 vs. 74.1\%), fewer witnessed arrests (48.1 vs. 52.9\%), half the probability of initial shockable heart rhythm (13.6 vs. 27.6\%), and similar rates of receiving bystander-CPR. Survival rates improved over time for both sexes, but men had higher 30-day survival than women, even in subgroup and adjusted analyses [odds ratios (OR): 1.29; 95\% confidence intervals (CI): 1.15--1.45, P \&lt; 0.001]. Sex-differences in survival were larger among those aged 50--75 years (in absolute and relative rates) and bystander witnessed arrests, while differences were smaller in those with initial shockable heart rhythms.Despite increases in 30-day survival for both sexes, women consistently had lower survival rates than men. Sex-differences were larger among those aged 50--75 years or with bystander witnessed arrests, but smaller in the subset of patients with an initial shockable heart rhythm.},
